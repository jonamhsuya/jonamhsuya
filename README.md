â€“ ğŸ‘‹ Hey! Iâ€™m Ayush, a first-year student at the University of Texas at Austin!

â€“ ğŸ’»ğŸ“ˆğŸ“š I'm deeply passionate about computer science, economics, and public policy. While I will be majoring in computer science, I seek to combine these three fields throughout my time in college and in my career as well.

â€“ ğŸ‘¥ I'd love to further my interests and career goals with new opportunities and, most of all, expand my network by meeting new people through LinkedIn. Feel free to connect or reach out to me about anything!
